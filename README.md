# localzure
LocalZure is an open-source tool that emulates Azure cloud services locally on a developer’s machine or CI pipeline. It enables developers to build, test, and debug Azure-based applications without deploying to actual Azure resources, reducing cost, improving development speed, and enabling offline workflows.
